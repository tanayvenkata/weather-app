# Weather Dashboard V1

A Python-based weather dashboard that generates a styled HTML report.

## Setup
1. Get a free API key from OpenWeatherMap
2. Create a .env file in the project folder
3. Paste this into the .env file: `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="your_key"`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run: `python weather.py`
6. Enter any city

## Features
- Real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API

## Languages Used
- Python

## Notes
I plan to edit these files once I've learned Javascript to enhance the functionality and provide interactive elements.
